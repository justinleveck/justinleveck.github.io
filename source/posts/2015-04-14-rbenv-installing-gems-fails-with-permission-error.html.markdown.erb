title: rbenv installing gems fails with permission error

Helping a new dev setup their machine today with `rbenv` when trying to
`bundle` I ran into this error:

```
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.
```

Thankfully I already dealt with this before and referenced it as a comment to
a question on StackOverflow. For my own future reference I will list the solution
here as well.


**You need to correct your paths**

To determine if this fix will work run the following:

    which gem

This should output a directory you do not have permissions to:

    /usr/bin/gem

**To fix this perform the following steps.**

 1. Determine the path you need to copy to your profile:

        rbenv init -

The first line of the output is the line you need to copy over to your profile:

```
    export PATH="/Users/justin/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}" #path that needs to be copied
    source "/usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/0.4.0/libexec/../completions/rbenv.zsh"
    rbenv rehash 2>/dev/null
    rbenv() {
      typeset command
      command="$1"
      if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; then
        shift
      fi

      case "$command" in
      rehash|shell)
        eval `rbenv "sh-$command" "$@"`;;
      *)
        command rbenv "$command" "$@";;
      esac
    }
```

 2. Copy the path to your profile and save it

 3. Reload your profile (source ~/.zshenv for me)

 4. Run `rbenv rehash`

Now when you run `which gem` you should get a local path that you have permissions to:

```
/Users/justin/.rbenv/shims/gem
```
